# Iris-classification-using-CNN
The objective of this project is to create a resilient and precise iris classification system capable of autonomously identifying, extracting, and interpreting iris patterns from digital images

Model training:-
The model is trained using MMU Iris dataset which is available in kaggle. The dataset has 46 classes.

Given files in this repository:-
- The file contains only the frontend part of the recognition system and does not contains the model training part.
- Here, this will only take the model weights to classify the input image by some image preprocessing.
